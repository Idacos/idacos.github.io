            an overview of its history, and some tips for getting into the competitive side of the game.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <h3>My Journey</h3>
          <p>My name is Ilton da Costa and I've been collecting Pokémon cards ever since I was 8 years old. 
            When I was younger, I would purely collect the cards, but now I'm heavily involved in playing the Pokémon TCG and
            staying updated with different metas and set releases.</p>
          <p>While I only collected when I was younger, I deeply got into the competitive scene of the TCG in 2020. As the 
            pandemic hit us, I found it as a new hobby to dive into and I was instantly immersed. Playing the game and learning the history
            of the game kept me enamored throughout the hard times in quarantine.

          <h2>Best Times</h2>
          <h3>Release Events</h3>
          <p>The best times to get some Pokémon cards is generally during set releases! 
            New sets in the United States are generally released every two months, with occasional mini-sets added in between.
            Each set provides generally 200+ new cards that both collectors and players can make use of!
          </p>
          <p>For those interested in competing, there are tournaments hosted year long by the Pokémon Company International in which anyone 
            can register for and compete in! However, if competing for official tournaments may seem daunting, plenty of local card shops host their 
            own tournaments for their community. This makes it easy for new players to get their foot into the door of competitive Pokémon.

          <h2>Best Locations</h2>
          <h3>Local Stores</h3>
          <p>The best places to find Pokémon cards are often local stores like Walmart, Target, and Gamestop.
            Though if you're able to, finding a local card shop might be the best option, as you can buy singles there, while also
            finding other people in the Pokémon TCG community to meet and hang out with.

          <p>One of the more popular card shops is known as Full Grip Games. They're located in Akron, Ohio, and gained its popularity
            due to the youtuber and twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/trickygym" target="_blank">TrickyGym</a>.

        <section id="how">
          <h2>How</h2>
          <h3>Getting Started</h3>
          <p>If you're just looking to collect, getting into the Pokémon TCG is extremely easy. I suggest by starting off with just picking
            up some product at a local store near you and open the packs inside of it! One of the best products to pick up is what is know as
            an Elite Trainer Box (or ETB for short). It generally provides 10 packs to open, some sleeves, dice, and coins which can be used in anyway
            you'd like, along with a booklet that lists each card in the set, which can help you to start collecting!
          </p>
          <p>If you'd want to get into the TCG competitively however, there are a few more steps you'd want to take. One of the best products to pick up
            for a new competitor is what is known as the league battle decks. They will often provide you with a strong deck to get you started along with dice,
            a rule book, and what to do in order to upgrade your new deck even futher!

        <section id="why">
          <h2>Why</h2>
          <h3>Nostalgia and Fun</h3>
          <p>For many people, collecting Pokémon cards is often about nostalgia. As Pokémon being such a large intellectual property, many young adults
            today are now collecting Pokémon cards out of nostalgia, as they would own Pokémon cards as a kid.
          </p>
          <p>While nostalgia may impact me, the main reason as to why I play the Pokémon TCG is because I find it extremely fun! It's very simple to get into 
            but still allows for depth and complexity the further you get into it, making is easy for both beginners and veterans to find enjoyment in the game.

        <section id="ai">
            <h2>AI Prompts</h2>
            <p>I used ChatGPT for 2 main sections of this assignment. The CSS as a base to build upon and the JS needed to
                hide the individual sections.
            </p>
            <p>
                I provided the assignment directions "Use an embedded stylesheet since this is all one page.
                Make sure the styling is nice and follows the CRAP principles, 
                No times new roman, generic blue underlined links, no white background, no black text, you get it."
                Afterwards, I created the color scheme to be more Pokémon themed.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the JS, I provided the directions "Research and find a solution using css and/or JS that hides all sections except the one you have clicked. 
                The idea is to mimic the nav bar in your main site, the user will click a "link" in your nav tag that will hide all the sections on the page and 
                ONLY display info of the section of choice. So if you click on the word "Best locations" in the nav bar, it will only display the "best locations" 
                section on the page and hide the rest so the user can't scroll to see it."
                With that,I incorporated the JS and CSS needed.
